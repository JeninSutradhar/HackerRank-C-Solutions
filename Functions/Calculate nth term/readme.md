Approach:
Given the constraints and the recursive nature of the series definition, the most straightforward approach is to implement a recursive function that computes the nth term based on the initial values a, b, and c.

Recursive Approach:
Base Cases:
If n is 1, return a.
If n is 2, return b.
If n is 3, return c.
Recursive Case:
For any n > 3, use the recursive formula:
𝑆
(
𝑛
)
=
𝑆
(
𝑛
−
1
)
+
𝑆
(
𝑛
−
2
)
+
𝑆
(
𝑛
−
3
)
S(n)=S(n−1)+S(n−2)+S(n−3)
This approach is direct and leverages the recursive definition of the series. It's simple to understand and implement, but it's important to note that recursion can be less efficient for larger values of n due to repeated function calls.
