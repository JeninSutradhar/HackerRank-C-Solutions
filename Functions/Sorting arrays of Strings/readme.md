Problem Description:
You need to implement a sorting function string_sort that sorts an array of strings (arr) based on one of four comparison strategies:

Lexicographically non-decreasing order: Sort strings alphabetically from A to Z.
Lexicographically non-increasing order: Sort strings alphabetically from Z to A.
Sort by number of distinct characters: Sort strings based on the count of unique characters they contain. If two strings have the same number of distinct characters, sort them lexicographically.
Sort by length: Sort strings based on their length. If two strings have the same length, sort them lexicographically.
