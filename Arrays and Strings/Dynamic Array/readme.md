Certainly! Let me break down the question, concept, and approach in simpler terms.
Explanation of the Question:
The question describes a library system in a city called HuskyLand. The librarian, Snow Howler, needs to handle three types of requests:

Add a new book to a shelf
Check how many pages a specific book has
Check how many books are on a specific shelf

Snow Howler's assistant, Oshie, can handle requests 2 and 3, but Snow Howler needs help with request 1 (adding new books).
The Concept:
This problem is about managing a library catalog using arrays in C. The key concepts involved are:

Dynamic memory allocation
Two-dimensional arrays (array of arrays)
Handling different types of queries

The library is represented using two main data structures:

A 1D array to store the number of books on each shelf
A 2D array to store the number of pages for each book on each shelf

Approach:
The approach to solve this problem involves:

Initializing the data structures:

Allocate memory for the array that stores the number of books on each shelf
Allocate memory for the array of pointers that will store the page counts for books on each shelf


Handling queries:

For type 1 queries (adding a book):
a. Increase the book count for the specified shelf
b. Reallocate memory for the page count array of that shelf to make room for the new book
c. Add the new book's page count to the end of the array
For type 2 and 3 queries, use the provided code to access and print the required information


Memory management:

Properly free all allocated memory at the end of the program to prevent memory leaks
